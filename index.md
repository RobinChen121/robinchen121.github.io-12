---

My name is Zhen Chen. I am a lecturer in Operations & Supply Chain Management at Brunel University London. Prior to this role, I served as a lecturer at Southwest University, China. I earned my PhD degree in Management Science and Engineering from Beihang University, China. During my academic journey, I had the privilege of being a visiting PhD student and a visiting scholar at the University of Edinburgh for two separate years. My primary research focus lies in cash-flow inventory management, where I leverage mathematical modeling and stochastic programming to address complex challenges.
