My name is Zhen Chen. I graduate from Beihang University, Beijing, China and hold a Ph.D. degree in management science (operational research).

I am now working as a lecturer at College of Economics and Management, Southwest University, Chongqing, China.

I like coding and take an interest in solving business operational problems through mathematics and computer programming.
