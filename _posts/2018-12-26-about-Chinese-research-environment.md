After stepping into academic research in China for more than 4 years and backing from one-year's research in UK, here I will talk about my feelings to the Chinese research environment.

I list some drawbacks of Chinese research environment below:

- Many Chinese professors are reluctant to do academic research after they became professors. They are more interested in applying for projects, and recruit many Ph.D. students to do projects and write papers for them.


- Many Chinese schorlars are short-sighted. They want to publish papers as soon as possible rather than trying to solve an academic problem.

- There exist some immoral behaviors like plagiarism in some Chinese research institutions. However, the punishments for these behaviors are not serious and harsh enough now.


There is still a large gap between Chinese science research with western counterparts, especially in the area of fundamental research. I think it may take several decades for China to solve the problems listed above and narrow this gap.
