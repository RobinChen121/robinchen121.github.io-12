After doing research for several years, sometimes I am wondering how much is the difference between what the academics are doing with reality.
That is to say, I find many acedemics papers are useless and not helpful to real practises, especiall in the business areas.

In business research, there are many assumptions in the papers. In order to obtain optimal solutions, some papers have to make additional assumptions, which makes the problem investigated very unrealistic.

Although some scholars have published a list of papers, he or she may not has solved a real business problem.

At present, this is my puzzel. Just a roast, carry on coding and math.
